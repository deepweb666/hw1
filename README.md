## Greetings, fellow github nerds! 
Alright, I might have lied. I’m more of a github noob, if anything.

`At first I thought this was supposed to be 1000 words long so enjoy my drawn-out introduction.`

Now, I’d like to kick this self-deprecating description by saying that it’s the first time I’m using github, though I am familiar with some html memery… Oh, the good old high school days…
My name is Anastasia Nalimova (yeah, like a fish), I’m 20 years old, I’m a Sagittarius with a Taurus rising and a burning desire to be what I like to call creative. Well, it’s better than weird, I suppose. I ~~wasted~~ spent my first year at MSLU, and now I’m a student at HSE. Yay! A freshman at 20!
⋅⋅* I enjoy weird comedy and so I couldn’t help but notice The Funk in the [summary of the lecture](https://ancatmara.gitbooks.io/digital-literacy-for-sfl/chapter1.html)
